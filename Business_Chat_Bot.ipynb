The best place to start the process of registering your \\nbusiness, and to discover all the other things you need to do to \\ncomply with the many regulations that govern small business, is the \\nCanada Business Network www.canadabusiness.ca/eng ).\\nIn this book we are not going to take you through all the steps \\nrequired to legally set up your business. This information is readily, \\nand exhaustively, available through several federal and provincial \\ngovernment websites, which guide you step-by-step through the \\nentire process.\\nSuffice it to say that the list of what you will need to do is long, and will include: deciding whether \\nyour business will be a sole proprietorship, partnership or corporation; registering the name of your \\ncompany; registering for GST/PST/HST (depending on which province or territory your business is in); \\nregistering for WCB/Worksafe; getting you local business licence; finding out what permits or licences \\nyou will need for your specific business, and more.\\nIt’s a lot of paperwork, but you only have to do it once and your accountant and lawyer will help you \\nif you get stuck. If you have enough start-up capital to pay professionals to do this for you, so much \\nthe better.P\\nSo, what are we going to talk about? Well, first off before you get carried away with the dream of being \\nyour own boss, and becoming the next Bill Gates, you should take stock and think about what life will \\nbe like as an entrepreneur. It’s easy to get excited about the potential for the product, or service you \\nare planning to sell, or the fact that at last you can truly turn your hobby, or natural skill into a way to \\nearn a living. The reality however, is that whatever business you are going to start, your primary role will \\nbe that of salesperson. That is the stark reality, unless of course you have sufficient start-up capital to \\nhire a sales team from day one. Even then, you will not be able to hide away in the back room avoiding \\ncontact with potential customers, suppliers, bankers and the multitude of other people who you will \\nneed to “sell” your business concept to.\\nI once knew a government worker, whose hobby was making wooden toys. He made the best wooden \\ntoys I had ever seen and whenever he showed them to people they wanted to buy them for their Introduction\\n5\\nwww.pacf.caPrince Albert and District Community  \\nFutures Development Corporationchildren, or grandchildren. He decided to leave his secure government position to pursue his dream \\nof making a living out of his hobby. Unfortunately he went out of business after a little over a year. The \\nreason? He loved making wooden toys - his passion was to make the best wooden toys anyone could \\npossibly make. Confused? Let me explain - he loved making wooden toys, he hated selling them, he \\nhated running a business, he hated being disturbed by customers when they visited his workshop - he \\njust wanted to be left alone to make his toys.\\nIn Starting a Business 101, we want to provide you with information and advice that is less readily \\navailable in start-up business books. First, we want to encourage you to look deep within yourself \\nto see if starting a business really suits you - after all we wouldn’t want you to leave a secure job, \\nlike our wooden toy maker, and fail, wishing someone had only warned you what entrepreneurship \\nwas really like. Basically, this volume is all about making you think about what’s important when \\nstarting a business. \\nAfter you’ve taken the To Be, or Not to Be an Entrepreneur  quiz, we look at how to come up with, \\nand judge, your business concept. Then to help you a little further with that all important task, we take \\na look at which business ideas are trendy at the moment. Even if none of them are within the realm of \\nyour expertise, or they simply don’t appeal to you, I urge you to take a good look at them because they \\ntell you what’s working out there in the world of business. What can you learn from these trends, and \\nwhat do they tell you about your particular business concept? Digging a little deeper, 12 Industries \\nto Consider  is well worth reading as it offers a great starting point for your investigation into what \\nbusiness might be best for you.\\nWhether to start your own business, or buy one that already exists (or a franchise maybe) is a serious \\nquestion that should be considered early on in deciding your entrepreneurial future. Reading Buy or \\nStart - The Pros and Cons , may change your mind about starting from scratch, or it might make you \\neven more determined to make your business idea a reality.\\nThe perennial problem with becoming an entrepreneur is the cost of starting, or buying a business. \\nDo You Have Enough Money?  gives you a quick overview of the sort of expenses you will incur, then \\nlooks at high and low cost start-ups, before talking about where the money might come from.\\nThe Power of Knowledge  focuses on something few, if any, books on starting up a business cover. It \\nis surprising how many people start-up a business in the dark, with no real education on the industry, \\nor market they are entering. Once, on a vacation in Spain, I was encouraged to enter a bull-ring to \\n“play-fight” a young bull. I had no idea what I was doing, had no training and it did not go well. I made \\na lot of rookie mistakes, such as holding the cape in front of me rather than to one side, and worst of \\nall I took my eyes off the bull. As soon as I did, it charged, I ran, I fell, and it gored me - not badly (the \\nbull’s small and conveniently blunt horn hit my hip bone), but enough for there to be a fair amount of \\nblood and causing me to walk with a limp for a few months. Learn from my mistake and don’t enter the \\nbusiness ring without knowing fully what you are getting into - do your homework and hopefully there \\nwon’t be too many gory surprises.6\\nwww.pacf.caPrince Albert and District Community  \\nFutures Development CorporationWhenever anyone starts a business the odds are against them, but there a number of things you can \\ndo to stack the odds in your favour. That’s where 7 Ways To Check Whether Your Business Will \\nFly can help. This chapter will help you assess whether there really is a market out there for what you \\nplan to sell.\\nWhatever business you start, you will need to ensure that it has something different about it, something \\nspecial. The Importance of Having a USP  deals with unique selling propositions, and provides \\nexamples of how some businesses set themselves apart from the crowd. It goes on to provide some \\nstrategies for discovering and developing your own USP.\\nWhat’s in a name? A great deal, as Choosing a Great Business Name  explains; for a start, \\nthese days you have to have a name that is available as a URL, otherwise you may be sending \\nyourself into Internet oblivion. It can’t be too clever, otherwise people won’t understand it, on the \\nother hand keeping with a family name can also potentially send the wrong message as with an \\nundertaker in Illinois called Slaughter and Son Funeral Directors. Sounds like something straight \\nout of the O.K. Corral!\\nBranding is becoming increasingly important in this day and age, where consumers are Internet \\nsavvy, and more knowledgeable about their choices and our products and services then ever before. \\nOur organizational culture is under scrutiny, so our branding had better be spot on. In It’s All About \\nBrand Image  we discuss all these issues and look at what the current trend is in terms of branding. \\nAn integral part of branding is the corporate website so we provide ten reasons why it is vital to have a \\nwebsite. If you count carefully, there’s a whole lot more than ten, because we cheat and include several \\npoints under each number!\\nWe finish off by providing the quiz results for To Be, or Not to Be an Entrepreneur and give brief \\ncomments on all 41 questions.\\nI hope that once you have read this book, taken the test, and carried out all the suggested research, \\nyou’ll have a good idea as to whether starting a business is right for you, and if that germ of a business \\nidea you have might stand a chance of success.\\nWhatever you decide, I wish you luck. It’s hard work starting a business, and even harder work running \\none. Success will depend on how you define it, and I can assure you the goal posts will change along \\nthe way, but for true entrepreneurs, there’s no other way of life.\\nMike Wicks\\nPublisher, Blue Beetle Books Inc.7\\nwww.pacf.caPrince Albert and District Community  \\nFutures Development CorporationThis exercise may look like a bit of fun, but if you \\ntake it seriously it will provide you with an insight \\ninto whether starting your own business is the right \\nroute for you to take. Of course, it’s only meant as a \\nguide, just one more thing to consider before taking \\nthe plunge into self employment.\\nThe test was designed to see how your social and \\npersonal traits compare with those of a typical \\nentrepreneur.\\nRunning one’s own business is definitely not for \\neveryone; it can be a highly stressful way to earn a \\nliving. On the one side you have total control over \\nyour life; there’s no boss telling you what to do \\nand when to do it. You are master, or mistress of \\nyour own destiny. But, there is a flip side; you will \\nwork longer hours and there’s no guarantee that, \\nmagically, money will appear in your bank account \\nbi-weekly, or monthly. That security of income \\nsuddenly disappears, as dozens of other things \\nrequire paying before you can take your wage.To get the best out of this pop quiz, you need to take \\na little time over it and consider each question and \\nthe multiple choice answers carefully. Remember, \\nyou’re the only one that will see the answers, so be \\nbrutally honest with yourself. It’s an important, often \\nlife-changing decision to become self-employed - to \\nstart a business and burn some bridges. You should \\nbe very sure that it’s the right way for you to proceed \\nwith your career, and your life.\\nYou might notice that some of the questions are \\nvery similar, but asked in a different way. Don’t over \\nanalyze the quiz, just answer each question as it is \\nasked. There is reason in our madness - honest!\\nYou might want to print off these few pages of your \\neBook so that you can check off your answers. \\nTaking the quiz is easy, just check the box on the \\nright-hand side that best represents your answer \\nto each question, then add up the number of \\ncheckmarks in each column, multiply it by the \\nfactor at the end of the column, then add all the \\ncolumns together to get a final score.To Be, Or Not To Be An Entrepreneur\\n8\\nwww.pacf.caPrince Albert and District Community  \\nFutures Development CorporationThat’s Me!

In this chapter we’ll look at some basic \\nguidelines, before providing an overview of global \\nbusiness trends.\\nHere are our top ten things to consider when \\ndeciding on what business you should start.1.  How knowledgeable are you about the \\nbusiness you are considering opening?  What \\ndo you know about the products, services, and \\nmarket? Look at businesses that you know very \\nwell, and not just from a technical perspective, \\nbut from a market standpoint.\\n2.  Make sure you have all the necessary \\nskills to run the business  (e.g. not just those \\nrequired to manufacture the product, or deliver \\nthe service). Remember no matter what the \\nbusiness is, you will have to do some selling.\\n3.  How much money do you have to invest?  \\nBusinesses such as graphic design and \\nconsulting require far less start-up capital, for \\ninstance, than opening a retail establishment. \\nBuying a franchise can be a good idea, but do \\nyou have enough capital for both the purchase \\nand the initial running costs?\\n4.  Think about what you enjoy doing, and what \\nyou are passionate about.  You are more likely \\nto stay the course and be successful, if you \\nenjoy what you do. However, be careful that \\nyour passion for your hobby doesn’t blind you \\nto the business potential it has. You may be an \\nexcellent writer of poetry, but making a living \\nfrom it is all but impossible. \\n5.  Decide what type of selling might be \\ninvolved.  A retail store for instance allows you \\nto be a little like a spider in its web, waiting for \\npeople to come along before interacting with \\nthem. Being a consultant on the other hand, \\nmeans cold calling and attending business \\nmixers. Remember selling is ALWAYS a major \\npart of any business.Your Business Idea11\\nwww.pacf.caPrince Albert and District Community  \\nFutures Development Corporation6. \\x07 How\\x07competitive\\x07is\\x07the\\x07field\\x07you\\x07want\\x07to\\x07\\nenter?  You may have worked for many years \\nas a lube technician and feel that you have \\nwhat it takes to launch your own business, \\nbut how many other oil and lube businesses \\nare there in your town, and is there enough \\nbusiness for another? Analyze your market and \\nsee how saturated it is. Remember, you will be \\ntrying to take market share away from existing \\nbusinesses, unless your business is the only \\none of its kind in the locale.\\n7.  Look for where there is a gap in the market  \\n-\\x07where\\x07there\\x07is\\x07unfulfilled\\x07demand.  If you \\nare looking at the retail market, is there a \\nproduct that people currently have to travel a \\nlong way to purchase? Consider the example \\nof social media consultants; as the business \\nworld started to see the potential for marketing \\ntheir products via Facebook, Twitter and other \\nsites, there was no one around to tell them how \\nto go about it. The gap was quickly filled by \\nentrepreneurs who saw a need that was at that \\ntime unanswered. \\n8.  Look at market trends and see what is \\nbecoming increasingly popular, and what \\nmay be coming to the end of its popularity.  \\nFor instance, now would not be the time to \\nopen a video rental store, or one selling CD’s or DVD’s. If, however, you can develop apps (or \\nperhaps be a reseller) for Smart phones then \\nyou’d be in a growing business. In 2010 the \\nindustry was worth around $1.7 billion, within \\nthe next three years it is predicted to grow to \\n$3.8 billion. Now, that’s a business to get into. \\nLater in the book, we’ll be taking a look at \\ncurrent business trends in more detail.\\n9.  Be wary of going into any business where \\nconsumers make their buying decisions \\nbased entirely, or primarily on price alone.  As \\nsomeone new in the market, your competition \\nwill have deeper pockets than you and you \\ncould watch your profit go down the drain as \\nthey undercut your prices. This is where service \\nbusinesses have the edge, as people don’t \\nchoose who they work with solely on price.\\n10.  Come up with several business concepts \\nand test them out.  The best thing you can \\ndo to prevent yourself starting a business that \\nsimply doesn’t work for you, is to work in it for \\na while. If, for example, you are considering \\nopening a coffee shop, go and work in one \\nwhile you are writing your business plan. \\nExperience the business first-hand and you will \\nnot only learn a great deal, but you’ll see if you \\nenjoy the environment. \\n12\\nwww.pacf.caPrince Albert and District Community  \\nFutures Development CorporationEverywhere you look pundits are predicting what \\ntype of businesses entrepreneurs should move into; \\nhere we take a look at the top five industries the \\nGlobe and Mail, in early 2012, suggested were the \\nbest for start-ups.  \\n1.  Elder Care -  we all know the population is \\naging, so it’s no surprise that this features \\nprominently. We are living longer, healthier, \\nand more independently - but the longer we \\nstay in our own homes the more help we’ll \\nneed.\\n2.  Health and Wellness -  everything from \\nhealthy food, to fitness gyms and regimes \\nare covered in this sector, along with health \\ncoaching and online health programs and \\napps.\\n3.  Warehousing -  as companies look for ways \\nto cut budgets, tying up money in expensive \\nreal estate looks less attractive when they \\ncould outsource their storage needs. This is \\nespecially true of companies where storage \\nneeds are seasonal. \\n4.  Shipping/Logistics -  as with warehousing, \\nsmaller companies are increasingly \\nlooking to outsource this work, providing \\nopportunities to entrepreneurs.\\n5. \\x07 Outsourcing/Staffing\\x07-  after downsizing \\nstaff during the tough economic times, many \\nbusinesses are recognizing that they can \\nmanage with temporary, or part-time staff \\ninstead of re-hiring.12 Industries or Markets \\nto Consider\\nThere are many types of businesses that offer a \\nbetter than average chance of success in today’s \\nbusiness environment, and if you go online you \\nwill find dozens of lists and all will be different. \\nThe list below is based both on solid research, \\nand many decades of helping people start-up new \\ncompanies. Treat it as a starting point for your \\ninvestigation of what might be the right business for \\nyou to start.\\nIf you find any of these markets interesting, \\ninvestigate them further on the Internet; within \\neach there are dozens, if not hundreds, of business \\nopportunities. Here we just give a short overview of \\nwhy they might be worth checking out.\\n1.  Consumer Staples -  at the end of the day \\nwe all have to eat, and we all use consumable \\nitems that we need to replace regularly. So, \\nmanufacturing such items, or buying and selling \\nthem will always be a solid business.\\n2.  Smart Phone Apps -  as mentioned earlier \\nthis is big business with some 500,000 Apple \\napproved apps to date. If you are thinking \\nthat making a business out of developing \\napps might be rather ambitious, check out the \\nfollowing Ted Talk given by an app developer \\ncalled Thomas Suarez, who just happens to be \\na 6th Grader! ( http://youtu.be/ehDAP1OQ9Zw )\\n3.  Elder Care -  First some facts: 5 million baby \\nboomers turn sixty years of age every year, \\nthat’s 416,666 per month, 96,153 per week, \\n13,698 per day, 9.5 per minute. A boomer turns \\nsixty every 6.3 seconds and every 7 seconds a Current Trendy Business Ideas13\\nwww.pacf.caPrince Albert and District Community  \\nFutures Development Corporation\\nboomer turns 50. This generation is living longer \\nand healthier, and remaining independent well \\ninto their dotage. As they remain in their homes \\nlonger, they will need supplementary care. This \\nis a market that is going to grow significantly in \\nthe coming years.\\n4.  Health and Fitness -  the general public is \\nbecoming increasingly interested in the state of \\ntheir bodies, whether it is losing weight, getting \\nfitter, toning those abs, or taking supplements. \\nThis marketplace is going to be hot for the \\nforeseeable future.\\n5.  Yoga -  although this could easily fit under \\nhealth and fitness we are highlighting it \\nafter Inc. magazine reported that Yoga \\nJournal carried out a study which found that \\nAmericans spent $5.7 billion on yoga products, \\nequipment, and clothing in 2008 (87 per cent \\nmore than they did in 2004). Inc. went onto \\nreport that nearly 14 million Americans say  \\na doctor or therapist has recommended  \\nyoga to them. \\n6.  Home Improvement -  The recent economic \\nclimate has led to many people putting off \\nmoving house, or renovating. This pent up \\ndemand for repair work, and upgrading, \\nis apparently beginning to be released. \\nGreen improvements such as solar power \\nare particularly hot at the moment (no pun \\nintended). This has always been a good market \\nfor self-employment, but now just might be a \\nparticularly good time to investigate this as a \\nstart-up business opportunity. \\n7.  Green Construction -  the move toward \\nbuilding green is accelerating. Consumers are \\nincreasingly looking to buy “green” houses, or \\ndo “green” renovations. Industry pundits report \\nthat “green” residential home construction will \\ngrow by some 500 per cent by 2016. \\n8.  Niche Consulting -  consulting has always \\nbeen a favourite start-up option as the cost \\nof entry is extremely low. In today’s economy \\nmany companies that laid off staff are now \\n14\\nwww.pacf.caPrince Albert and District Community  \\nFutures Development Corporationseeing shortages in certain skill sectors, \\nwhich they need to fill by outsourcing. What is \\ninteresting is that increasingly, corporations and \\ngovernment are moving from larger agencies to \\nsmaller firms that specialize in a niche market. \\nHot niches right now include anything that \\nsaves companies money, sustainable business \\npractices (including greening) and social media.\\n9.  Accounting Services -  an increase in outsourcing \\nin general, is benefiting businesses in this market. \\nBookkeeping is an especially low cost, easy entry, \\nstart up business with great potential. As new \\nbusinesses are starting up all the time, there is \\na never-ending supply of potential new clients, \\nand as we slowly come out of the recent tough \\neconomic times, there will be a matching need for \\naccounting services in general.\\n10.  Fast-Casual Dining - According to MainStreet \\nRestaurant Licensing Ltd., which is a full service \\nCanadian private equity company servicing the \\nfood-restaurant-hospitality industry, “Full-service \\nrestaurants are passé. Hybrid, fast-casual \\nrestaurants offering high quality and delicious \\nfood à la carte at pocket-friendly prices are \\nthe new sweet spot of the growing economy. \\nThe master concept of fast casual restaurants \\nis based on two most important parameters – \\ngreat quality fresh food and instant service.\\xa0The \\nfast casual restaurant segments have been \\ngrowing at a tremendous rate, thanks to the \\nmulti-fare menus that offer ‘more pocket-friendly \\nchoices’ to the customers and multifaceted \\ngrowth opportunities available in the highly \\nlucrative food business.” One sector of this \\nnew market that may be of particular interest \\nto entrepreneurs looking for a low-cost way to \\nenter the market is Food Trucks. A survey carried \\nout by the National Restaurant Association (NRA) \\nfound that 30 per cent of chefs consider mobile \\nfood trucks to be one of\\xa0the hottest operational \\ntrends. For more information on this trend visit: \\nwww.mainstreetrestaurants.ca/hottest-segment.\\nphp. If you are considering entering the food \\nindustry we advise you to download the NRA’s \\nsurvey: www.restaurant.org/pdfs/research/\\nwhats_hot_2011.pdf . 11.  Online Shopping - Although dominated by \\nretail giants such as Amazon, Apple, Best \\nBuy/Future Shop there is plenty of room for \\nstart-ups to enter this market. According \\nto Statistics Canada, a little over half of all \\nCanadian web surfers purchased something \\nonline in 2010, buying on average, $1,300 \\nworth of product with a total market value of \\n$15.3 billion. Interestingly 8 out of 10 bought \\nfrom Canadian sites.\\n12.  Repair Services -  As the general population \\nbecomes more environmentally friendly, the \\ndesire to repair, rather than replace, a wide \\nrange of items offers good opportunities for \\nentrepreneurs. We are hanging on to our \\ncars longer and getting them fixed, we are \\nrepairing our shoes and electronic goods, and \\npurchasing spare parts for stoves, dishwashers \\nand other appliances. Mister, or Ms Fixit’s are \\nbecoming sought after commodities.  \\n15\\nwww.pacf.caPrince Albert and District Community  \\nFutures Development CorporationBuy or Start - the Pros and Cons\\nOne big question entrepreneurs have to ask \\nthemselves is, should I buy a business, or should \\nI start one from scratch? The answer to that is a \\nresounding, “It all depends.”\\nThere are pros and cons to both approaches and \\na lot depends on what sort of business you are \\nlooking to start, what your skill level is relating the \\nbusiness you are planning, and how much money \\nyou have to invest.If you are looking to start a home-based business \\nin the consulting field for instance, then the \\nchances are that you can do this yourself with little \\nto no outside help. If you want to offer a mobile \\nmechanic service, again it may be fairly easy to \\nset this up yourself. But, if you want to start selling \\npizzas then you might want to at least investigate \\nthe potential of buying a franchise as this could \\nsave you a lot of effort and give you a recognizable \\nbrand name from day one.\\n16\\nwww.pacf.caPrince Albert and District Community  \\nFutures Development CorporationLet’s do a quick analysis of some of the pros and cons of buying a business, or a franchise.\\nPros Cons\\nYou are buying an established brand name, which \\nmeans that you will have credibility from day one, \\nand people will have an expectation of quality and \\nconfidence in you that might take months, if not years to \\nbuild on your own.Buying a business can be costly, and is often more \\nexpensive at the outset than starting your own. \\nRemember however, that much of what you purchase \\nwhen you buy a business will still have to be bought \\nover time for your own start up.\\nAs long as you do your due diligence, the business \\nconcept will already have proven itself. It works, is \\nknown to generate revenues and more importantly a \\nreasonable profit.You have to invest money in getting each prospective \\nbusiness opportunity thoroughly checked out to the nth \\ndegree, by your accountant and lawyer.\\nIt is likely that you will purchase all the equipment \\nyou require to run the business, along with a starting \\ninventory. In the case of a franchise, you may get \\npreferential pricing on the equipment you need.It is difficult to gauge the life left in much of the \\nequipment and some of it may be at the end of its life. \\nThe inventory you purchase may not all be good; there \\nmay be a high percentage of slow selling items.\\nIf it’s a business, they will have all their operational \\nsystems up and running. This will allow you to hit the \\nground running. A franchise will have proven systems in \\nplace.\\nThe existing business owner may agree to a transition \\nperiod and help you to learn the systems etc.It’s great to have systems, but they may not suit the \\nway you work, or fit the way you see the future of the \\nbusiness.\\nYou already have clients, or customers, and the goodwill \\nthat has been built over the years. You will see revenue \\nimmediately.How much of the goodwill was based on the personality \\nof the owner? If customers frequented the business \\nbecause of him, or her then will they keep using the \\nbusiness when you take over? This is why a handover, \\nor transition period is important.\\nIf you need to borrow money, or get a line of credit, \\nyou have a business history on which the bank can \\nbase a decision. You may even be able to take over the \\ncompany’s line of credit, or loans. Just as important is \\nthat you have, or should have immediate cash flow.The bank will still want to check your personal \\ncreditworthiness. \\nYou may be able to take over existing staff, who possess \\nthe skills required to deliver the products and/or services \\nyou provide, know the equipment and systems in use - \\nand have a relationship with your customers.You get the good with the bad as far as employees \\nare concerned. It is wise to interview existing staff prior \\nto purchasing the business, or between buying the \\nbusiness and taking over the operation.\\nYou can start work on growing the business from a solid \\nbase from day one. Most of the hard work establishing \\nthe company has been done for you.17\\nwww.pacf.caPrince Albert and District Community  \\nFutures Development CorporationOverall, most experts would suggest that you have a better chance of success if you purchase an existing \\nbusiness. But, let’s look at the pros and cons of starting your own business so that you can make your own \\ndecision.\\nPros Cons\\nStart-up costs are under your control and are often less \\nthan when purchasing an existing business.Your business may be under-capitalized as you try \\nto spend the least amount of money to get it off the \\nground. It can also take a lot longer to establish yourself, \\nwhich can lead to additional financing pressures.\\nYou start with a blank slate. The concept, the products \\nand services, the branding can be tailor-made to your \\nbusiness philosophy and organizational culture.You have no brand, no credibility, no share of the market \\n- you are unknown. You have to create the vision, the \\nproducts and services and they may not be proven. \\nThere is considerable room for getting it wrong.\\nYou can find a new market niche that no one else is \\ntaking advantage of.These are few and far between. Often, there is no one \\nservicing a niche market because it’s not big enough, or \\nit’s been tried and the business, or businesses failed.\\nSuccess or failure is all down to your own efforts and \\ndetermination.The failure rate for start-ups is higher than for existing \\nbusinesses. The one-year rate is around 85%, but drops \\nto 50% at five-years* which would indicate that it’s \\ntough to establish a new business. These stats are for \\ncompanies with paid employees, so don’t include one-\\nperson businesses. Business experts, such as Michael \\nGerber, the author of the E-Myth, are less optimistic \\nsaying that the survival rate is as low as 20%.\\n \\n*  See: The State of Entrepreneurship in Canada: Industry Canada  \\n(www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/sbrp-rppe.nsf/vwapj/SEC-EEC_eng.pdf/$file/SEC-EEC_eng.pdf )\\nThink long and hard about your options when it comes to deciding between buying, or starting, a business. \\nConsider all the pros and cons and above all else get advice from business people you know, business \\naccount managers at banks, accountants, lawyers, experts in your chosen industry and market, and \\nanyone else that you can think of. Then, go online and read as much as you can about the business you are \\nthinking of starting or buying. It is vital that you are thorough in your due diligence. 18\\nwww.pacf.caPrince Albert and District Community  \\nFutures Development Corporation\\nThe majority of entrepreneurs underestimate  \\nthe amount of money they need to start a  \\n business. Here is a list of some of the things you \\nshould consider:\\n1. All the paper, and professional help - licenses, \\npermits, incorporation, legal fees, accountancy \\nfees, partnership agreements, and more.\\n2. Equipment (manufacturing machines, \\ncomputers, printers, cash registers, alarms, \\nchairs, desks, phones, the list goes on)\\n3. Inventory: goods, or raw materials\\n 4. Insurance - liability, errors and omissions, life, \\nbuilding etc.\\n5. Rent, and any leasehold improvements.\\n6. Hydro, gas, oil, water, telephone, Internet etc.\\n7. Staff payroll, taxes, benefits, WCB/Worksafe\\n8. Delivery, warehousing, courier, postage etc.\\n9. Marketing costs: business cards, stationery, \\nadvertising, website, mailing lists, online, etc.\\n10. Association membership\\n11. Travel, accommodation, entertainment, \\nconferences\\nIn many cases, this list will only represent the \\nstarting point of all the money you will need to find \\nto fund your start-up. And, all that is before you start \\nto pay yourself. Remember, you are unlikely to start \\nyour business one day and be able to pay all your \\nexpenses from profit the next. Cash-flow is a critical \\ncomponent of survival, so it is vital that you have \\nsufficient capital to bridge the gap between the day \\nyou start your business, and the time your business \\ncan not only sustain itself, but make a profit.                  \\n   \\nHigh Cost - Low Cost Start Ups \\nMore expensive start-ups require:\\n• Inventory\\n• Commercial premises, which may or may  \\nnot require leasehold improvements\\n• Staff\\n• Promotional budget\\nLess expensive start-ups are usually:\\n• Home-based\\n• Service focused\\n• Owner operated\\n• Use contract staff when required Do You Have Enough Money?19\\nwww.pacf.caPrince Albert and District Community  \\nFutures Development Corporation\\nA lot depends on the size and type of your \\nbusiness. Home-based businesses need a relatively \\nsmall amount of money, while larger businesses in \\nmanufacturing, or retail require larger capital to get \\noff the ground.\\nHere are a few places to go in search of  \\nstart-up funding.\\nPartners\\nPartners can be a blessing and a curse. On the \\nupside many hands make light work, and if you \\ncan find someone you can trust that \\nhas a whole bunch of skills, \\nwhich are complementary to \\nyour own, then this may be \\na good way to share the \\nfinancial burden. But, if \\nyou are only bringing in \\na partner for his, or her, \\nmoney then you should \\ntake into consideration \\nthat you are giving that \\nperson a significant say in \\nhow your business operates \\n(how much will depend on the \\nlevel of financial support, and the \\nagreement you reach).Whatever the circumstances, you will require a \\npartnership agreement drawn up by a lawyer. Talk \\nto your lawyer and accountant, but it is usually \\nadvisable to incorporate your business if you are \\ngoing to have a partner, or partners. If you have \\nissues later, it will make things a lot easier.\\nThe other thing to remember is that it is all well \\nand good getting a bunch of cash when you need \\nit most, at the outset of your business, but what \\nabout sharing the profits down the road? The \\namount of money you thought was a godsend \\nwhen you were struggling to get off the ground, \\nmay not seem much when compared to the \\npotentially large sums of money going out of the \\nbusiness to a silent partner in dividend payments.\\nGrants - Don’t buy a grant book\\nThe biggest message here is that there are almost \\nno grants available to help you start a for-profit \\nbusiness. There are plenty of grant books available \\nonline that promise millions of dollars in available \\nfunding - they are not worth buying, for two reasons \\n1) all the information is available through government \\nsources for free, and 2) there is very little free money! \\nNow, I have to qualify that last statement slightly by \\nsaying there are some government grants but they \\nare for very specific types of businesses, doing very \\nspecial and unique things. If you still want to check \\nout whether there could possibly be a grant for \\nyour business, the best place to start looking is the \\nCanada Business Network  \\nwww.canadabusiness.ca/eng/guide/1136 .\\nLoans\\nSmall business start-ups find it difficult to get \\nloans from traditional sources. Don’t even \\nconsider approaching a bank unless you have an \\nexcellent personal credit rating and a first-class, \\nprofessionally written, business plan. Even then, \\nyou will often find it difficult if you haven’t built up \\nan excellent relationship with the bank.So, Where Do You Get the Money From?20\\nwww.pacf.caPrince Albert and District Community  \\nFutures Development CorporationCommunity Futures Development Corporations  \\nrun a small business loan program which is well \\nworth checking out. Here is a typical overview of \\nthe program, in this case from Western Canada \\n(just Google CFDC plus your town and you will be \\nable to access information about the loan program \\nin your part of the country).\\nThroughout Western Canada the locally run, \\nnon-profit, Community Futures organizations \\nhave achieved outstanding success by \\nintegrating the social and economic needs of \\ntheir communities. A wide range of services \\nand financing opportunities are available to \\nsmall businesses and entrepreneurs at the local \\nCommunity Futures (CF) offices.\\nIn general, businesses seeking financing must:\\n• be located in a rural area of one of the \\nfour Western provinces (Manitoba, \\nSaskatchewan, Alberta or British Columbia)\\n• be operating, or about to operate, in a \\ndesignated Community Futures area\\n• contribute to local economic growth\\n• be seeking financing of up to $150,000\\nLoans on commercial terms, equity financing \\nand loan guarantees are available through the \\nCommunity Futures offices. Applications are \\nassessed by the Community Future’s local \\nvolunteer Board of Directors. Training and \\nassistance preparing business plans are also \\navailable at the Community Futures offices.\\nAs each Community Futures community is \\ndifferent, specific financing activities undertaken \\nby each individual Community Futures office \\nvaries from community to community. Search \\nour Business Service Network database to \\nlocate the network offices nearest you or visit \\nthe Community Futures national\\xa0 website.\\nThere are several loans programs aimed at women \\nand first nations’ entrepreneurs. Often these are \\ndelivered provincially and we encourage you to \\nseek them out.One such program aimed at women is offered \\nby the Women’s Enterprise Centre  in BC. It \\noffers loans up to $150,000 for women in B.C. \\nand has lower fees than many other lenders. The \\ncentre loans money for leaseholds, equipment, \\noperating capital and more. Their loans come \\nwith free, ongoing business advice delivered by \\nprofessionals. To find out more you can participate \\nin one of their weekly phone-in Business Loans \\nInformation Sessions.\\nFor First Nations entrepreneurs in Atlantic Canada \\nthere is the Aboriginal Business Development \\nFund (Ulnooweg Loan)  managed by the Atlantic \\nCanada Opportunities Agency. This Government \\nof Canada fund is offered in New Brunswick, Nova \\nScotia, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland and \\nLabrador only. For more information click:  \\nwww.canadabusiness.ca/eng/summary/1228 .\\n21\\nwww.pacf.caPrince Albert and District Community  \\nFutures Development CorporationOther regions and provinces offer similar programs, \\nso search the Internet and you will find a wide \\nvariety of loan programs offered by agencies  \\nacross Canada.\\nBank of Mom and Dad\\nIt’s surprising how many young entrepreneurs get \\ntheir first business loans from friends and family, \\nand more often than not it’s mom and dad that \\ncome to the rescue. This can be by way of a formal \\nloan with shares, or part ownership, or informal on \\nthe understanding that they will get their money \\nback (with or without interest) once the business \\nis successful. This type of financial help is based \\non blind faith, and requires little to none of the due \\ndiligence a bank, or an outside investor will require.\\nCreative f\\ufeffinancing\\nOver the years I have helped thousands of small \\nbusinesses start-up and their creativity surrounding \\nearly financing, when the banks wouldn’t touch \\nthem, never ceases to amaze me.\\nThink about what you can sell that could raise \\nthat highly important start-up capital. I have \\nseen people sell their boats, Harley-Davidson \\nmotorcycles, cigarette card and stamp collections, \\neven houses. It is a good indication of an \\nentrepreneur’s commitment to his or her idea, when \\nyou see them sell something they treasure. Bank \\naccount managers are particularly impressed when \\nentrepreneurs are willing to risk their own assets.\\nAnother imaginative entrepreneur, a few years ago, \\nskirted the law when she used several department \\nstore credit cards to buy products and then \\nreturned the goods, charming the male clerk into \\ngiving her cash back. Thus a successful small \\nbusiness was launched. This is not a method of \\naccessing start-up funding that we recommend for \\nmany reasons, not least because the interest rates \\ncharged by such credit cards is extremely high.\\nPrograms\\nThe Self-Employment Program, offered by the \\nfederal government through service agencies \\nacross Canada, is an employment program that \\nprovides financial and entrepreneurial assistance to eligible individuals to help them create jobs for \\nthemselves by starting a business. While it doesn’t \\nhelp with start up costs, it does offer financial \\nassistance through participants being able to \\nreceive E.I. benefits while on the program.\\nGovernment programs change all the time, and \\nfinding information on the self employment program \\nat national level is quite difficult. However, at \\nthe local level try your local Community Futures \\nDevelopment Corporation as they might be \\ndelivering it, if not they will usually know where to \\nsend you. \\nConclusion\\nI hope that this dose of reality has not disillusioned \\nyou, because no matter how hard starting a \\nbusiness is, it is without doubt possible. Take a look \\nat this list of under-capitalized start-ups that made \\nit big. The following is based on brand values as at \\n2011, taken from the Brandz Top 100 Most Valuable \\nGlobal Brands study (click here to see the top 100 \\nwww.millwardbrown.com/libraries/optimor_brandz_\\nfiles/2011_brandz_top100_chart.sflb.ashx ):\\n• Starbucks was started by three guys in 1971 \\nwho invested $1,350 each. 2011 brand value: \\n$119 billion.\\n• UPS - was started by a couple of teenagers \\nwho possessed one bicycle between them and \\n$100, 2011 brand value: $35.7 billion.\\n• Apple - It’s 1976, two guys make a sale, buy \\na bunch of parts bought on credit and deliver \\nsome computers. 2011 brand value: $153 billion.\\n• Gillette started in 1903 with 25 cents. 2011 \\nbrand value: $19.7 billion.\\n• Nike, in 1963, launched with $1,000. 2011 brand \\nvalue: $13.9 billion.\\n• Hewlett Packard started in 1938 with the \\nprincely sum of $538 dollars. 2011 brand value: \\n$35.4 billion.\\nYou can do it too, with a lot of hard work, sound \\nplanning and perhaps more than a fair share  \\nof luck.  22\\nwww.pacf.caPrince Albert and District Community  \\nFutures Development CorporationIf you are considering starting, or are in the process \\nof starting, a business then the single biggest \\nthing you can do to stack the odds of success in \\nyour favour is to increase your knowledge base on \\neverything that might have an impact on it.

If \\nnot, then it would be wise to seek out the answers \\nbefore going forth into the marketplace.\\n• How does your product/service help your \\ncustomer?\\n• What needs/problems do they have that your \\nproduct/service answers?\\n• How does it solve their problem(s)?\\n• What are the strengths of your product over \\nyour competitors?\\n• What are the weaknesses of your product in \\ncomparison to your competitors?\\n• Do you know the complete technical \\nspecifications of your product?\\n• How competitive is your pricing?\\n• In what way is your product or service unique? 25\\nwww.pacf.caPrince Albert and District Community  \\nFutures Development CorporationOne of the biggest mistakes new entrepreneurs \\nmake is failing to check whether there is actually a \\nmarket for what they plan to sell. You may believe \\nthat the business concept, the product, or service \\nyou have come up with is the best thing since \\nsliced bread, but other than your friends and family \\ndoes anyone else? Let’s face it, someone even \\nbelieved that an energy drink, named “Cocaine” \\nwith it’s bright red can and lettering which looked \\nlike white powder, would sell like hotcakes. \\nSurprise, surprise it was taken off the shelves by \\nthe FDA, but with major retailers refusing to stock \\nit, it would have bombed anyway. \\nIf you carry out the following research you will \\nincrease your chances of business success \\nby more than you could ever imagine. Many \\nbusinesses fail because something unexpected \\ncame out of left field. If you are fully aware of what the competition is for what you are going sell, then \\nyou can structure your business plan and marketing \\nstrategy accordingly.\\n1. Check out the competition\\nThis is one of the areas new entrepreneurs fail to \\naddress properly; in many cases they ignore it \\nbecause they don’t want to hear any bad news, \\nsuch as, the market is flooded with businesses \\noffering the same, or better products or services \\nat less than they can afford to charge. Then there \\nare the new business owners who believe that their \\nidea is unique, and that there is no competition for \\nit - without ever thoroughly checking. More often \\nthan not, there is competition, but they haven’t \\ndiscovered it. If there isn’t any competition at all, \\nthen that in itself is a red flag and should elicit the \\nquestion, “Why not?”\\n7 Ways To Check Whether Your Business Will Fly26\\nwww.pacf.caPrince Albert and District Community  \\nFutures Development CorporationSearching for competitors should be seen as an \\nopportunity to discover gaps in the market. It also \\nallows you to see what prices are being charged, how \\ncompanies market themselves, what market they are \\naiming at, and what their weaknesses might be.\\nIf you know the town, or city, you are opening your \\nbusiness in well, then you probably already know \\nthe main local competition. But, what about online \\ncompetition? Today, more than ever, your potential \\ncustomers may be able to purchase what you sell, \\nor something similar, from anywhere in the world. \\nCreate a list of words and phrases that identify your \\nindustry, your business, your products and your \\nservices; then use your favourite search engine \\nto search each word and phrase and see who is \\nsupplying that market, both locally and globally. \\nThink like one of your customers when searching - \\nwhat would they enter when they search for what \\nyou sell? Remember, even those people who prefer \\nto shop locally will often research online before \\nseeking you out, so they will know what your local \\nand global competition are offering both in terms of \\nprice, choice and service.\\n2.  Carry out a strengths and weaknesses \\nanalysis of your competition\\nIn point one, we talked about how your customers \\nwill search and research online for products and \\nservices just like yours. Now, imagine you sell \\nApple iPads and the new model has just been \\nannounced. Apple sends out emails to every Mac \\nuser to promote the fact that its new version will \\nbe released in 2-weeks, and includes a prominent \\nlink to the Apple Online Store. It’s easy for your \\ncustomer to click the link, go to the store and \\norder their iPad in seconds, even have it personally \\nengraved for free. Then they just have to sit back \\nand wait for the UPS guy to bring it right to their \\ndoor. No need to line-up at your store on the morning the iPad is released, or risk you being \\nsold out by turning up a day or so later. Now, Apple \\nhas some huge advantages over you in the scenario \\nabove - call them strengths, but is there anything you \\ncan offer that might outweigh the pluses on their side \\nof the scale? Maybe it’s the fact that people can’t \\ntake the new version for a test run first, perhaps being \\nable to buy from a real person is important to them, \\nor that they feel more secure knowing that if they get \\nit home and it won’t turn on they can probably get a \\nreplacement immediately at your store. Or, it could \\nbe even simpler - they like you and your staff and \\nrespect the fact that you support the community by \\nsponsoring the Little League.\\nThe thing is - it’s important to know the strengths \\nand weakness of your competition. Know the \\nstrengths so you can combat them with your \\nstrengths, and know their weaknesses because \\nthese you can exploit. It could be as simple as the \\nfact that it is difficult to park at your competitor’s \\nlocation, but you have ample free parking. In this \\ncase you highlight free parking in all your marketing.\\nDon’t just think about the strengths and weaknesses \\nof your competition in an abstract way, write them \\ndown and study them. Here is a simple table you \\ncan use; just list multiple competitors and think \\nabout each company’s strengths - the things that \\nmake people want to buy from them. It could be \\nthat they are established, their prices are low, they \\nare convenient, they advertise heavily, they deliver - \\nanything you can think of. Then do the same for their \\nweaknesses - perhaps they have a poor reputation, \\na poor product range, awful customer service, they \\nare in a bad location - again think of anything they \\ndon’t do well. Ask your friends, family, and social \\nmedia contacts what they think.\\nOnce you have carried out this exercise, do the \\nsame thing on your own company, or business \\nconcept if you haven’t yet launched your company.\\nCompany Strengths Weaknesses27\\nwww.pacf.caPrince Albert and District Community  \\nFutures Development CorporationThis exercise will save you a lot of heartbreak \\ndown the road, and a great deal of money up front \\nas you will be able to ensure there is a market for \\nwhat you sell, and target your marketing dollars far \\nmore effectively.\\n3. Send out a survey to everyone you know\\nIn the last point we talked about asking friends, \\nfamily and social media contacts what they \\nthink about your competition. This can be done \\neffectively using a simple survey. There are several \\nonline services that allow you to build your own \\nsurvey for free. Check out www.fluidsurveys.com ; \\nwww.surveymonkey.com ; www.zoomerang.com  \\nwww.hostedincanadasurveys.ca  - these are just \\na few of the company’s offering free, or low cost \\ncreate-you-own-surveys.\\nThese surveys can also be used to obtain \\nfeedback on a wide range of things that are vital \\nto the success of your company and its products \\nand services, including: what people like and don’t \\nlike about your proposed products and services; \\nwhat they would be willing to pay; the number of \\ntimes they might purchase in a year; and where \\nthey currently purchase similar products - this is \\nan opportunity to find out everything you need \\nto know, so add your own questions. And, it’s \\nnever been easier; if you have a Facebook page \\nor have connections on LinkedIn use these to ask \\nyour ‘friends’ to complete the survey. Don’t forget \\nto use Twitter to Tweet a link to the survey and \\nyou may be surprised how many people will offer \\ntheir opinions, especially if you can offer some \\nincentive to people completing your survey, such \\nas a discount coupon, or code.\\n4. Check out your industry and market\\nInformation is power, and the more you know about \\nyour business and the world it exists in the more \\nlikely you are to avoid being hit by a curve ball. We \\nlive in a fast-moving world; your industry and your \\nmarket are fluid; what was true today, may not be \\ntrue tomorrow.\\nCustomers are attracted to businesses and people that are experts at what they do; the more \\nknowledge you have and can impart to your \\ncustomers, the better your credibility and the more \\nlikely people are to buy from you.\\nThere is no excuse with today’s easy access to \\ninformation, not to be highly educated about your \\nindustry, market, suppliers, competitors, even the \\nraw materials you use, and to follow the global \\nevents that might have an impact on them.\\nThere are two easy ways to become an expert \\non your industry, the first is to simply Google it \\nand see who are the main people talking about \\nit - these pundits can be a mine of information, \\nespecially as they are often tracking trends as \\nwell. Follow them through the newspapers and \\nmagazines they write for, and also see if they have \\na blog which you can follow.\\nThe second way is to set up a Google news \\nalert. As soon as anything occurs in the media \\nconnected with your industry you will receive a link \\nto the sources. This means you can keep up to \\ndate with events as they happen. News alerts are \\nsimple to set up, just visit  http://news.google.ca/\\nnwshp?hl=en&tab=wn  and enter your search words \\nor phrase and it will list all current news items. \\nOnce you have done that go to the bottom of  \\nthe page and it will ask you, “Keep up to date  \\nwith these results: Create an email alert for...” Click \\non the link, fill out the form and you will receive \\nnews information on your industry everyday, or \\nevery week - your choice.\\n5. Check review sites\\nSo, by now you have become very knowledgeable \\nabout what’s happening in your industry. Now, \\nlet’s dig a little deeper and see what people are \\nsaying about the market leaders, and your local \\ncompetition. Today you can easily find out what \\npeople are saying about your business, and just \\nas importantly about your competition. Never \\nbefore has it been so easy to gain an insight \\ninto what other people think, as bad reviews \\nespecially can go go viral in minutes. Take a look \\nat the following sites that either elicit reviews in 28\\nwww.pacf.caPrince Albert and District Community  \\nFutures Development Corporationa specific industry, or allow people their say on \\nan industry, and companies worldwide. One of \\nthe most used examples is www.tripadvisor.ca  \\ncurrently celebrating 60,000,000 reviews of hotels, \\nrestaurants and attractions.  www.yelp.ca  lets \\npeople review and search local businesses - try it \\nout by entering any business you frequent and you \\nwill see what people are saying about it. Search out \\nyour competition and you are one step closer to \\nknowing what your potential customers want, and \\nmore importantly don’t want.\\nPeople can also research products and prices \\nonline at sites like Consumer Search  \\n(www.consumersearch.com ) and Next Tag  \\n(www.nextag.ca ). Today there is nowhere for your \\ncompetition to hide - but remember, it works both ways!\\n6. Attend a trade show, or conference\\nDo a little research and find out when the next trade \\nshow is happening, at which your competitors and/\\nor your prospective customers are likely to attend. \\nTrade shows are usually open to people in the \\nindustry at no charge, so go along and see how \\nsimilar businesses to the one you are planning to \\nlaunch are marketing themselves. What products \\nand services are they selling? How much are they \\ncharging? How busy are their booths? Talk to the \\nattendees and ask them what they think of the \\nshow. What companies are impressing them? Have \\nthey seen any interesting new products or services? \\nDo they think the industry as a whole is fairing well \\nin today’s economy? How do they see the future?\\nAttending an industry conference will allow you \\nto mix with your peer group and learn more about \\nwhat the industry itself is doing. Of course, with \\nconferences there can be a cost to attend, but \\nconsider offering yourself as a speaker, especially \\nif you have some expertise to offer, or maybe as a \\npanelist on a discussion panel or forum.\\nThis type of on-the-ground research can be \\ninvaluable to a start-up business.\\n7. Check the social networking sitesLast but not least, be nosy. Sign up for the \\nFacebook pages of businesses like yours, whether \\nthey are competitors or not, and listen to the \\nconversations. Attune yourself to what’s happening \\nat street level and you will get a feel for what your \\npotential customer base wants from a business like \\nyours.\\nJoin LinkedIn, if you are not already signed up, and \\nbuild a network of connections in your industry and \\nwith people that can help you build your business. \\nRemember though that all social media activity \\nneeds to be social and not promotionally driven. \\nNetworking is like a healthy bank account, you \\nshould always put in more than you take out.\\nTen More Questions You Need to Ask\\nSo, you’ve done everything above. Now, can you \\nanswer the following ten questions? If not you \\nstill have a little more work to do before deciding \\nwhether the business idea you have will actually \\nhave a chance of being successful.\\n1. Do people need what you are planning to sell?\\n2. Can you clearly identify the people, or \\ncompanies that may buy your product? That is, \\ndo you know who they are?\\n3. Is the market big enough?\\n4. Do you know how you are going to reach \\npotential buyers?\\n5. How much will it cost to reach the market and \\ncan you afford it, given your profit margin?\\n6. Do you know who your competitors are, and are \\nthey servicing the market need well enough?\\n7. Do you fully understand your competitors’ \\nstrengths and weaknesses?\\n8. Is your unique selling proposition strong enough \\nto allow you take a share of the market away \\nfrom the competition?\\n9. Do you know what price the market will bear?\\n10. Can you make a large enough profit, based \\non the information you get from your market \\nresearch? 29\\nwww.pacf.caPrince Albert and District Community  \\nFutures Development CorporationWhatever business you decide to launch, it needs \\nto stand out from the competition. If your business \\nis identical to your competition, then you will be \\nforced to compete on price alone, and that can be \\na tough fight if they are well established and you \\nare fighting for market share.\\nThat’s where discovering, or creating your USP \\n(Unique Selling Proposition) is a vital component of \\nyour start-up strategic planning. It’s tough to make \\na go of a new business and establish yourself, but \\nit’s a whole lot tougher if there is nothing to set you \\napart from the crowd.\\nA USP is something that makes you special in \\nthe eyes of your customers. For instance there is \\na mechanic shop in Toronto called Ms. Lube that \\nis owned by a woman, and she only hires women \\nmechanics. They claim to be the first repair shop \\nof their kind in North America - now that’s a  \\ngreat USP!What you are doing when you create a USP for \\nyour company is positioning yourself, it’s a strategic \\nactivity and allows you to advertise and promote \\nyour business with a unique message.\\nUSPs need to be specific, and are far more than \\njust words - they are more of a philosophy that \\nunderpins your business. It’s not about being the \\nbest – it’s about being different.\\nHere are a few examples of companies with \\nexcellent USP’s.\\nThe Saddleback Leather Company  - sells \\namazing leather briefcases, suitcases and saddle \\nbags. Its primary USP is that it gives a 100-year \\nwarranty that you can pass down to your heirs, but \\nthe company is so darn different that once you visit \\nits website you’ll see why it’s not just the warranty \\nthat makes this company special.  \\n(www.saddlebackleather.com )The Importance of Having a USP\\n30\\nwww.pacf.caPrince Albert and District Community  \\nFutures Development CorporationThis next one is a feel-good USP . If you buy a \\npair of Toms Shoes  they will give a pair to a child \\nin need somewhere in the world. To date they \\nhave given away one million pairs of shoes. Every \\nweek they choose one customer and follow their \\npurchase around the world on a Toms giving trip. \\nWatch their video at: www.toms.com/one-for-one .\\nNot all USP’s have to be feel good though, some \\ncan challenge the establishment. S**tcreek \\nConsulting  attacks the highbrow, and high-cost, \\nestablishment consultants by telling things as \\nthey are, and by shocking people. Does it work? \\nProbably not on everyone, but as they say on \\ntheir website if you believe that a consultant is \\nsomeone who, “Borrows my watch, tells me the \\ntime and charges me for it” they may be the type \\nof consulting firm you might like to talk to. A cartoon \\non their home page sums up their USP , and their \\noverall philosophy, the caption reads, “After the \\nbig boys f**k it up completely, feel free to give us a  \\ncall.” As I say, not for everyone, but it appeals to \\nenough people to make it a highly successful USP . \\nCheck them out at www.shitcreekconsulting.com . \\nAs I mentioned, this particular USP may well \\nput some people off dealing with their company, \\nbut to others it is a breath of fresh air amongst \\nthe plethora of rhetoric coming from traditional \\nconsulting firms.\\nEight Foundational \\nPrinciples of a USP\\n1. It gives your company a unique image.\\n2. It is the focal point of your company.\\n3. It makes your company appealing to a certain \\ntype of customer.\\n4. It is part of the character, personality and \\nphilosophy of your company.\\n5. It is the foundation of your marketing strategy.\\n6. It provides excitement.\\n7. It differentiates you from the competition.\\n8. It gets you noticed.Tips on Discovering  \\nYour USP\\nFirst things first - you can’t please everyone. A USP \\nis not a catch all - remember the anti-establishment \\nconsulting firm mentioned earlier? One good way to \\nget started is to answer the question - who would \\nbe an ideal client? Once you know who it is you \\nwant to attract, the easier it will be to discover the \\nright type of bait.\\nHaving said that, here are a few strategies to get \\nyou started.\\nUse your personality  -there’s nothing more unique \\nthan you! How can you figure in your USP?\\nFind a gap in the market  - or discover a need. \\nDon’t look at what your competition is doing - look \\nat what they’re not doing.\\nExplore the intersection of ideas  - What is your \\nbusiness truly about? What can you add to the mix \\nto make it more interesting and unique?\\nNarrow your target audience  - finding a niche can \\nalso mean discovering your USP . There is a financial \\nplanner in Victoria, BC that specializes in advising \\nphysicians and dentists. He writes books advising \\nthem, and is a highly sought after keynote speaker.\\nNarrow your topic  - for example, be a florist but \\nspecialize almost exclusively in selling orchids.\\nCarry out a strengths and weaknesses analysis  \\n- make a list of all your competitors and make a \\ntable for each of them listing all of their strengths \\nand weaknesses. Now make one for your own \\ncompany’s strengths and weaknesses. Study the \\ntables and you may well see a pattern that will lead \\nyou to your USP . Need a clue? Think about how to \\nmake one or more of their weaknesses into your \\nmajor strength.\\nBrainstorm  - gather friends, family, your banker, \\nyour accountant, your lawyer, your business \\nfriends and anyone else you can think of, supply 31\\nwww.pacf.caPrince Albert and District Community  \\nFutures Development Corporationpizza and beer and have a good old fashioned \\nbrainstorming session. Encourage silly, even \\nridiculous, ideas because that is often where \\nthe diamonds lie. Have one rule - during the \\nbrainstorming session no one is allowed to say \\nthat an idea is good, or bad - just write the idea \\ndown on a flip chart, or white board. Later you \\ncan discuss the pros and cons of each idea. The \\nreason for this is that positive affirmation makes \\nothers think that their idea isn’t as good as the one \\ngetting all the acclaim, and negative comments, \\nof course, embarrass people and make them think \\nthat their idea might also be criticized. In both \\ncases people are unlikely to voice their opinion. To \\nmake it a little more fun, give out soft foam balls \\nthat can be thrown at anyone making a positive, or \\nnegative comment. Trust me, it makes the whole \\nsession fun and encourages people to open up \\nand be creative.\\nWatch television commercials  - check out the \\nUSP’s being promoted, and see if you can steal \\none from another industry and adapt it to work in \\nyour market.\\nHere are a few very basic potential USP’s. None are \\nas strong as the ones in the examples cited earlier, but they have the potential to be developed, or \\nincluded with a stronger USP .\\n• Best price in town (N.B. This is not a USP by \\nitself - and you had better be able to deliver)\\n• Quickest delivery (can you keep it up?).\\n• Free delivery (only if no one else offers it).\\n• Longest guarantee (e.g. Sears children’s \\nclothes: if they wear out before the child grows \\nout of them they are replaced free of charge).\\n• Widest selection.\\n• Friendliest staff.\\n• Best parking.\\n• Toll free number.\\n• Best quality (hard to prove - although \\nSaddleback Leather Company implies it with \\ntheir 100-year warranty).\\n• 2 for l (this is no longer the USP it used to be, \\nas people have become suspicious the price  \\nis inflated).\\n• Free gift with purchase (hard to be unique, \\nunless totally unheard of in your industry). \\n32\\nwww.pacf.caPrince Albert and District Community  \\nFutures Development CorporationNaming a business should not be taken lightly; it \\nwill be your identity in the years to come. You need \\nit to be memorable, you need people to like it and \\nunderstand it - and more importantly it needs to fit.\\nThe Key Elements of a \\nGreat Name\\nCan you get the URL?  First things first, in this \\nInternet dominated world you have to have to be \\nable to get a URL to match your name. It doesn’t \\nmatter how much you love the name you’ve \\nchosen, or how fitting it is to your business, if \\nyou can’t get the URL then forget it. I would even \\ngo so far as to say that if you can get .ca but not \\n.com then reconsider your name. Ideally you want \\nto be able to have both domain names because \\npeople type .com automatically by default. Be extra \\ncautious if the name you have chosen is similar to another company in the same industry as you. \\nIn this case people can get you confused with the \\nother company and go to them when they meant to \\ngo to you, or hear bad things about your competitor, \\nbut think of you when they hear the comments. \\nThe bottom line is, be original and ensure you get \\nthe primary domain names and there can be no \\nconfusion between you and any other company.\\nThe name has to work - it has to do its job, and \\nit\\x07has\\x07to\\x07fit.\\x07 Think of the couple that started “Rent \\na Wreck” - they came up with the idea of renting \\nwell-used vehicles instead of new vehicles like all \\nthe other rental companies. Great idea, but how \\ndo you think the company would have fared if they \\nhad called the company “Premium Rental”? “Rent \\na Wreck” made people sit up and take notice - it Choosing a Great Business Name\\n33\\nwww.pacf.caPrince Albert and District Community  \\nFutures Development Corporationalmost forced them to check the company out. Did \\nthey really rent wrecks? Could that be right? Of \\ncourse, once people discovered that the cars were \\nnot actually wrecks, but well maintained slightly \\nolder vehicles available at a far lower price, they \\nwere happy to have discovered a cost-effective way \\nto rent a no frills vehicle.\\nOther names that really work include “The Bathtub \\nDoctor”; Mr. Lube; PayPal, and more recently Twitter.\\nYour customers have to understand it  - Would \\nyou know what the company Analtech does? \\nWould guessing help, or perhaps you wouldn’t \\nwant to know! What about a child’s clothing store \\ncalled Kids Exchange? Would you dare take your \\nchild there? But the one that really confuses, and \\nworries me is Fifth Third Bank - what the devil does \\nit mean? Are they on Third Street, or Fifth? Don’t \\nthey know? Is it some kind of new math? In fact, \\nthe name came about after a merger between two \\nbanks and they forced their names together.\\nYour name shouldn’t actively put people off . \\nBelieve it or not there is a Herpes Pizza restaurant, \\na fashion store called Ick, a BBQ Tanning salon, and \\nmore than one hair salon called Curl up and Dye. \\nI’m not sure about you, but none of those names \\nencourages me want to frequent their businesses.\\nDoes your name mean something, or is it just a \\nname?  Many people just call their company after \\ntheir own name. This may work if they are a lawyer, \\ndoctor or dentist, where it is important that the \\ncustomer knows whose particular credentials they \\nare putting their trust in. However, most companies \\nfind that a name that explains exactly what they \\ndo provides the best advertising. Sometimes, you \\nshould stay well clear of using your own name - for \\ninstance what were the owners thinking when they \\ncalled their Illinois business, Slaughter and Son \\nFuneral Directors?\\nIs it memorable?  Your name is part of your brand \\nso you want it to have the ‘sticky’ factor - you want \\npeople to remember it, after all you will be spending \\na lot of money on business cards and advertising. Nike and Toys R’ Us are both easy to remember. \\nAlthough the former took a lot of promotional \\nactivity to establish. There was a logic to it however, \\nas Niké is the Greek goddess of victory.\\nThe bottom line is a good name tells people what \\nyou do. Make it easy for people to find you and \\nunderstand exactly what you do within the market \\nyou operate in.\\nDoes your name explain enough about your \\ncompany?  Let’s do a little business name \\ncomparison between names that identify what the \\ncompany does, and those that don’t quite hit  \\nthe mark.\\n• Fast Frame versus De Bruin Picture Framing \\n- the former clearly wins here as you instantly \\nknow what they sell, and that they specialize in a \\nquick turnaround.\\n• Midas Brake and Muffler, or Budget Brake and \\nMuffler versus Razor Brake and Muffler - now \\neach company tells you what it offers, but the \\nfirst two tell you that you can expect low prices.\\n• Harbour Air Seaplanes, or Seeair versus \\nCameron Air - it’s immediately obvious that the \\nfirst two fly float planes, but less obvious with \\nthe latter.\\n• Budget Car Rental versus Avis - both successful \\ncompanies, but the name budget implies you \\nwill get a better deal.\\n• Bath Wizard, or Bathtub King versus Loumerico \\nRefinishing and Coating - now the latter does tell \\nyou exactly what the business does, but is it as \\nmemorable as the first two? \\n• Safe and Secure Locksmiths versus Greene \\nLocksmiths - which would you choose?\\nIt’s not that you can’t be successful with the type \\nof name that we have shown last in the examples \\nabove and it’s not necessarily that the names are \\nbad, it’s just that when you launch a business you \\nwant to make it as easy for yourself as possible. \\nIdeally you want people to say, Great name! I like \\nit!” You want to make an impression right out of \\nthe gate. We doubt for instance that there is a 34\\nwww.pacf.caPrince Albert and District Community  \\nFutures Development Corporationgreat deal of difference in the cost of renting a car \\nfrom any of the rental car companies, but many \\nconsumers (especially first time renters) may well \\nlean toward Budget Rental rather than Avis, in the \\nabsence of any other determining factors. But, you \\ncan make any name work - if you have enough \\nmoney to promote it extensively.\\nThink of the future.  A great name can work for a \\nwhile, but if your business changes or expands will \\nyour name still be as effective? Check out these \\nexamples.\\nUnited Carpet  - this tells you exactly what the \\ncompany sells, but did you know that they also sell \\na wide range of other types of flooring? If you were \\nlooking to buy ceramic tile would they be one of the \\nfirst names you thought of visiting?\\nBurnaby Kawasaki  - when you link your name \\nto the town you are in, and then build a good \\nreputation everything seems rosy, but what if due \\nto your success you want to open up in another \\ntown? Maybe the name will carry some weight, \\nbut it’s no longer having the original desired effect. \\nFurthermore, what if you have difficultly with supply, \\nor lose the distributorship, and need to start selling \\nother brands?\\nDowntown Photo Centre  - great name unless you \\nexpand to the burbs, then how does it work?\\nComputer Software Unlimited  - again, impressive, \\nbut it doesn’t work as well when you start to branch \\nout and sell computers and printers.\\nBlenheim Coffee - nothing wrong with this name, it \\nexudes refinement, but what if you want to break \\ninto the fashionable trend toward premium teas?\\nWestern Inflatable and Boat Centre  - This company \\nnow sells fishing charters and a wide range of other \\nproducts, but if you didn’t know them would they \\nbe a first choice when looking for a fishing trip?\\nArctic Air  - Great name when they just serviced \\nrefrigerators and freezers, but would you go to them to have your stove, hot air dryer, microwave \\nor washer serviced?\\nMake your name easy to say and easy to spell.  \\nThink about people searching for you on Google, or \\nwhile driving, through directory inquiries.\\nImagine opening a car dealership in a small town \\nin Wales and deciding to call yourself after the \\ntown you are in, and your business becomes Neath \\nNissan - nothing wrong with that, but what if you \\nlived in Lanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwll-\\nllantysiliogogogoch? Not such a good idea. Okay \\nthat was pushing the envelope a bit, but you see \\nwhat I mean; if your name was Piotr Tomaszewksi, \\nwould it be a good idea to call your company \\nTomaszewksi Engineering Inc. Probably not, \\nunless you were specifically targeting the Polish \\ncommunity in your area.\\nYour name needs to be easy to remember, easy to \\nsay, easy to spell and look good in print.\\nIt should also be available as a domain address, \\neither in full, or abbreviated, if it makes sense to do \\nso. Basically, you need to make it easy for people \\nto Google, or Bing you.\\nThe Legal Stuff\\nWhen you apply to incorporate a company under the \\nCanada Business Corporations Act, you may choose \\nto use a corporate name, or have a numbered name \\nassigned to you. Although incorporating under a \\nname involves additional effort and expense, there \\nare advantages to doing so.\\nThere’s a bunch of legal stuff you have to do \\nwhen registering a name and it must meet certain \\nrequirements before it is approved by Corporations \\nCanada. The best thing you can do is to read the \\nName Granting Compendium put out by the federal \\ngovernment; it will answer all your questions.

But is all this enough?\\nIn these tough economic times, small businesses \\nneed to stand out from the crowd, and more \\nimportantly look professional. A lot is said about \\ncorporate branding, and most small business \\nowners know that it’s more than just a logo, or a \\nclever name, but how much more?\\nYour brand is the distinct elements and attributes \\nof your product, and your company, communicated \\nthrough an image (or images) and words. It’s a \\npromise, an expectation of performance and a \\nmark of integrity and reputation. For instance, if \\nwe ask for a Kleenex everybody understands we \\nare referring to a tissue; if we say we are looking \\nto buy a Jacuzzi it doesn’t necessarily mean \\nwe specifically want that brand of hot tub. A brand is the totality \\nof perceptions that a consumer holds about the \\nexperience they associate with a product or a \\ncompany. When we visit a Pizza Hut or Wal-Mart \\n(love them, or hate them) we know exactly what to \\nexpect from the brand, and therefore we are rarely \\ndisappointed. \\nToday, the trend in branding is toward what \\nis called “human brands.” In response to the \\neconomic collapse in the U.S. brought about by \\nbusiness bad practices and dishonesty, there is \\na level of distrust in the public that needs to be \\novercome. The immediacy and openness of the \\nonline world is driving consumers toward brands \\nthat are human, have personality and are open, \\nhonest and transparent.\\nThink for a moment about how you want to portray \\nyourself to your future customers. Consider what \\norganizational culture your company will have - \\nwhat do you believe in, what do you stand for, \\nwhat is your mission? Think about how you \\nwant customers to It’s All About Brand Image36\\nwww.pacf.caPrince Albert and District Community  \\nFutures Development Corporationthink of you. Or, how you want them to perceive \\nyour company. Be sure. Take a few minutes and \\nask some of your potential customers (not your \\nfriends or family - they’re biased) what they think \\nof the name of your company. Show them the logo \\nyou are planning to use (it doesn’t matter if it’s in \\na draft format) and any slogan you might plan to \\nuse, and encourage them to tell you what it says, or \\nmeans to them. No prompting! Their answers might \\nsurprise you.\\nThe aim of this exercise is to discover whether your \\nfuture customers’ perceptions of you are in line with \\nwhat you want them to be. If the two perceptions \\nalign, then you’re probably doing a good job, but if \\nthe majority of people either have no opinion, or see \\nyou as something you are not, then you might have a problem. For instance, I know of a consignment \\nstore specializing in high-end, used, designer \\nwomen’s clothing. The owner, on surveying her \\ncustomers, discovered that the majority found her \\nstore by chance, or by recommendation, and that \\nthey originally thought (from her brand image) that \\nshe ran an ordinary used clothing store. In this case \\nher brand image had obviously been misleading \\npotential customers; when she changed it to \\npromote a more up-market image, she introduced a \\nwhole new clientele to her product line.\\nIt’s all very well knowing what a brand is, but how \\ndo you discover the right brand for your company? \\nYou could, of course, hire a company to brand \\nyou, and they may well do an excellent job. A \\ngraphic designer will create an evocative logo and \\na marketing consultant will develop a targeted \\nmessage, but will this be enough, will it resonate \\nwith your customers and prospective customers? \\nMaybe, maybe not. \\nWhat forward-thinking small business owners are \\ndoing, is enlisting customers to help reinvent their \\nbrand, and help get their image back on target. \\nIn your case you have the opportunity to start out \\nwith a powerful brand right from the get go. It’s \\nreally quite simple, ask your prospective customers \\nwhat’s important to them when dealing with you. \\nWhat is it that will encourage them to buy from you, \\nrather than your competition? What makes you \\nunique or special in their eyes? Ask them to sum \\nup what they think about your business concept, \\nproducts and services in a single sentence. You \\nmight even develop a survey, and either hand it \\nto people who you think might be interested in \\npurchasing from you in the future, or use a free \\nonline survey service such as SurveyMonkey.com \\nand send it to your list. \\nOne thing is for sure, the resulting brand will be \\nmade up of your company’s identity, essence, \\npersonality, image, character and culture – it will be \\nyour brand, freshly created for you by those people \\nwho are invested in your success, not something \\ncreated in a sterile vacuum.  \\n37\\nwww.pacf.caPrince Albert and District Community  \\nFutures Development Corporation\\nThis is a question many people ask when opening a \\nbusiness that does not have an online component. \\nHowever, the simple truth is that if your company \\nis not on the worldwide web then to many people it \\ndoesn’t exist. To many people a company without \\na website can’t be a real company, and they will \\nbe duly suspicious of it. Companies are expected \\nto have a website, not having one will affect your \\ncredibility - period. But, what are the other reasons for having a presence on the web? Here are our top \\nten reasons to have a website, over and above the \\ncredibility issue.\\n1. It’s an incredibly cost effective brochure, that \\ncan be updated quickly and easily. You can also \\neducate your market by offering more detailed \\nand intensive documents, for those who want to \\ndelve deeper into what you offer.How Important Is It to Have a Website?38\\nwww.pacf.caPrince Albert and District Community  \\nFutures Development Corporation\\n2. The number of people using Yellow Pages, or \\nother directories, to seek out businesses is \\nfalling rapidly - people use the Internet to search \\nfor businesses, opening hours, prices etc. Not \\nonly are people looking for the opening hours \\nand contact information online, they are also \\ndoing comparison shopping prior to turning \\nup at your establishment. If you don’t have an \\nonline presence, then you may not feature on \\ntheir prospective supplier’s list at all!\\n3. You can say a tremendous amount on a website \\nat no additional cost. From photographs of \\nyour products, testimonials and personnel \\nbiographies, to demonstration videos and \\nblogs, you can reach out to your customers and \\npotential customers like never before.\\n4. It allows you to present your brand, and your \\norganizational culture. What is it they say? “You \\nare what you wear” - and just like your clothes \\nyour website says a lot about you! That’s not all, \\nas fashion changes, or you need to update your \\nbrand, it’s easy and quick to rebrand your web \\npresence.\\n5. Through blogs and other social media, you \\ncan interact with your customers no matter \\nwhere in the world they live. It reaches out far \\nbeyond your primary target market into multiple \\ndemographics, across continents and across \\ncultural divides. Heck, you can even offer your \\nsite in multiple languages at a very low cost.6. It can offer you a whole new sales avenue as \\npeople purchase online. 24/7 sales becomes \\neffortless! Even if you don’t sell product, people \\ncould book appointments online, just as easy as \\nthey book hotel rooms.\\n7. Without a website your competitors are one \\nstep ahead of you - actually get real, they’re \\nlight years ahead of you! Be sure to make your \\nwebsite more attractive, more informative and \\neasier to navigate than theirs!\\n8. You can feature downloadable documents, \\nbrochures, price lists, technical spec sheets and \\njust about anything else on your website to save \\nmoney on printing and mailing print materials - \\nand help save the planet at the same time.\\n9. With a FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) \\npage you can save yourself, or your customer \\nservice team a lot of time as people can find the \\nanswers to their questions online.\\n10. A website is a lifesaver when selling, or dealing \\nwith a customer, by telephone - simply direct \\nthem to your website and you can show \\nthem photographs, give demonstrations and \\npresentations, show them videos and just about \\nanything else.\\nThere are many more reasons than those listed \\nhere, but you get the message - if you want to \\nsurvive in business in today’s business environment \\nyou must have that all important online presence. 39\\nwww.pacf.caPrince Albert and District Community  \\nFutures Development Corporation1 I’m always trying to convince people to believe what I believe.  When you run your own business you \\nhave to sell yourself, your concept, your business and your products or services.\\n2 I tend to lose my temper with people quite easily when they’re not with the agenda.  You can’t avoid \\ncustomers, or clients, when you’re running a business and they can often be difficult. Lose your temper \\neven once and it can ruin your reputation.\\n3 I have a lot of friends and family who support my ideas and plans.  It’s a stressful life being in business \\nand you have to be surrounded by people that are supportive and understanding. When you can’t pay \\nyourself one month because you have to pay staff, or a supplier, you will need a spouse that stands by you \\nand your decisions and doesn’t lose faith at the first sign of trouble. To Be, or Not to Be an Entrepreneur - The Quiz Results\\nSo, is being an entrepreneur the \\nright course for you? \\nA score of 41 to 65  indicates that you will almost \\ncertainly fit well into the role of business owner. \\nYou have what it takes to fight for success and \\nstick with it when the going gets tough. You have a \\nbetter than average chance of surviving in what is a \\ntough and challenging environment.\\nA score of 66-89  shows that you have a good \\nchance of being successful as an entrepreneur, \\nhowever there are some skills and attitudes that you \\nmight want to develop to improve your chances.\\nA score of 90-122  means that you should consider \\ntaking some courses on starting a business. Also \\ntalk to several entrepreneurs and ask them what \\nthey feel are the key characteristics and personality \\ntraits you will need to be successful, and ask \\nyourself honestly if you possess them. Talk to \\nthem about what life is like as an entrepreneur and \\nconsider carefully whether this is really the life you \\nwant for yourself.\\nA score of 123  is unlikely, but if that’s what it \\nadds up to, think long and hard as to whether \\nthis is the life for you. No one should enter into \\nself-employment lightly, it’s a very tough life. Be \\nhonest with yourself, wouldn’t you be better off and \\nhappier working for someone else?To get a better idea of why we asked the questions \\nand to relate them to the score guide above, read \\nthrough our comments below.  \\n \\n40\\nwww.pacf.caPrince Albert and District Community  \\nFutures Development Corporation4 I have several friends and acquaintances who run businesses and often chat with them.  Getting \\nthe inside scoop from someone who’s been in the trenches is vitally important. It’s so much better to learn \\nfrom other people’s mistakes than pay the cost yourself.\\n5 I am comfortable talking to strangers on the phone.  Although we all chat away via email, text \\nmessaging, Facebook, LinkedIn, the telephone is still the way most of us make first contact. It’ s the way \\nwe set up appointments, the way we deal with inquiries and the method many of our clients first contact \\nus. If you don’t like using the phone then this could be a challenge for you in your business.\\n6 I like people to agree with me, but it’s more important that they respect me.  In business, your integrity \\nis on show and it is vital that you have the respect of not only your customers, but your employees and the \\nbusiness community as a whole.\\n7 I find it quite easy to get people to do what I want them to do.  This is back to the question of being \\nable to sell. If you have that knack of being able to convince people to do the things you want to do, then \\nthat will carry over to your business life and be a great asset.\\n8 I’m a people person.  This is big - you have to like people to be in business. It’s no good thinking that you \\ncan hire other people to handle all the interaction with clients, customers and the business community. You \\nare the face of your business.\\n9 I have had experience managing people.  Any experience you have in managing people will be \\nan enormous asset when running your own business. Think about all the times you have taken a \\nmanagement role; it doesn’t have to have been during employment, it might have been coaching a sports \\nteam, or running a little league, or as part of other volunteering.\\n10 I get really frustrated when people are slow, or do a job badly, or provide bad service. Entrepreneurs \\nare not the most patient of people; they can always see a better and faster way to do things and have a \\nhabit of taking over if they see inefficiency.\\n11 I like the idea of working alone.  It’s lonely at the top and many start-up businesses launch with just the \\nentrepreneur working from home. If beginning as a home-based business try not to isolate yourself too \\nmuch, get out and network, meet old colleagues for coffee - be part of the real world. Many start-ups \\nclose after a year or so because the entrepreneur misses interacting with the ‘real’ world.\\n12 I’m always reading about the industry and market I plan to open my business in.  The people who \\nusually succeed in any business are those that are passionate about what they do. These people are \\ntotally immersed in their industry; they read trade journals, know all about new technology applicable to \\nwhat they do and follow the leaders and pundits in the industry.\\n13 If I really believe in something, I have a tendency to ignore the opinions of other people.  Self-belief \\nis at the heart and soul of true entrepreneurs. Nothing will put them off following their dream. They are self-\\nopinionated and often do not give enough credence to the opinions of others.\\n14 I laugh at myself often. To be successful, an entrepreneur has to have fun and see the funny side of the \\nups and downs of business. They can’t, and don’t, take themselves too seriously.\\n15 I get really bored, really quickly!  Impatience is at the heart of most entrepreneurs’ psyche. They are busy \\npeople, often good at multi-tasking and always looking for the next interesting opportunity.\\n16 I’m a morning person, I wake up believing that anything’s possible if I have the right attitude.  \\nEntrepreneurs, almost by definition, are optimists otherwise they would never start a business in the first \\nplace. Not only do they wake up raring to go, they often have a pen and paper on their nightstand to catch \\nall those ideas that occur to them in the middle of the night!\\n17 I love new technology, new ideas and new ways of doing things.  Like cats, entrepreneurs are curious \\ncreatures always looking for what’s new. They are very likely to have the latest iPhone, or tablet and their \\ncomputer is almost certainly less than three years old.41\\nwww.pacf.caPrince Albert and District Community  \\nFutures Development Corporation18 I do masses of research online, before I make a purchase decision.  Business success comes from \\nhaving all the relevant information you need before taking the next step. \\n19 I’m a well organized type of person.  Because successful entrepreneurs are constantly multi-tasking they \\ncan often appear, and be, disorganized. However this disorganization is more on the surface than in their \\nmind.\\n20 If I don’t know much about some new area of interest I usually want to find out more about it.  As \\nmentioned earlier entrepreneurs are inquisitive. They always want to know more about things and are \\nconstantly asking questions. They are usually excellent at research and can ferret out information on just \\nabout anything.\\n21 I like to feel appreciated. I want people to recognize the work I do.  Having a big ego goes with the \\nterritory. Take a look at all the hugely successful businesspeople around the world and you will see some \\nmassive egos. If you watch Celebrity Apprentice, you will see wonderful examples - how would you feel if \\nyou could emulate the big “Don” and have your name written in gold on hotels and office blocks?\\n22 I like to look at the big picture rather than the minute details.  Entrepreneurs are goal oriented, they are \\nenvisioning the end result and they hire other people to deal with the minutiae involved in reaching their \\ngoals.\\n23 I’m pretty good at picking myself up and brushing myself down after a let down.  Every \\nentrepreneur has felt failure usually more than once. There is no doubt that you will be metaphorically \\nkicked in the teeth at regular intervals. What’s important is how you deal with the downturns and curve \\nballs business life throws at you.\\n24 I have a good handle on my life and can discipline myself to do what needs to be done, when it \\nneeds to be done.  Entrepreneurs may well be dreamers, but they have the discipline to do what needs to \\nbe done and to stay the course.\\n25 I have a great imagination and can vision what my future will look like.  Back to being big picture \\npeople, but more than that entrepreneurs need to be creative, they need to be visionaries.\\n26 I always see the silver lining in challenging times and find wher e the opportunity is.  It’s not what \\ngoes wrong, it’s the attitude you have towards dealing with the challenges running a business throws at \\nyou.\\n27 I’m generally a brave person where life is concerned.  Make no mistake you will need a lot of courage \\nto be self-employed and to grow a business. This life is not for the faint-hearted.\\n28 I am okay with taking risks. It’s risky starting a business and no mistake. Try to start a business without \\ntaking any risks and you will undoubtedly fail. But, a good entr epreneur qualifies all risks by thinking every \\nmove through carefully and planning for every eventuality.\\n29 I am often accused of being controlling.  Entrepreneurs are Type-A personalities, it’s in their make-up.\\n30 People think of me as being enthusiastic and energetic. If you’ve ever been accused of being the \\nEnergizer bunny, then you’re probably suited to being an entrepreneur.\\n31 I know how to fight for what I believe in and have done so in the past. No one ever said starting-up \\nand running your own business was going to be easy. You will need to fight for your market share every \\nstep of the way.\\n32 I hate being stuck in a rut, I hate routine. Being employed is having a routine - if that sounds okay, then \\nstep away from being an entrepreneur. On the other hand if you want to enter a life where almost anything \\ncan happen from day-to-day, both good and bad, stressful and elating, then welcome aboard.42\\nwww.pacf.caPrince Albert and District Community  \\nFutures Development Corporation33 People trust me and know they can rely on me. Whether they are or not, some people appear honest \\nand others not so much. If people think of you as being trustworthy and more importantly, reliable you \\nhave a better chance of success in business life.\\n34 I am confident in myself and my abilities.  Successful businesspeople believe in themselves no matter \\nwhat. Do you think Donald Trump ever doubts himself? Not so much.\\n35 When I make a mistake I put a positive spin on it by realizing that mistakes are just a way we learn \\nhow to do it better next time.  Entrepreneurs are constant learners and see the mistakes they make as \\njust another way to learn how to do things better next time. They don’t beat themselves up over it, they \\njust get on running their business better.\\n36 I like to be healthy and look after myself.  Life as a small business owner is frenetic, stressful, joyful, \\ntiring and 101 other things. But, it can be hard on your body. Being fit at the outset is a bonus to starting a \\nbusiness, staying fit is vital to your future success.\\n37 When I’m low, I can usually pull myself through it by thinking positively.  We all get down from \\ntime to time, especially during tough times, but entrepreneurs dig deep and always find a way to pump \\nthemselves up, put on a smile and bring back that positive attitude. It is the key to their success.\\n38 I’ve been asked to leave, or been fired from a few jobs in my time, because I was a difficult \\nemployee.  It is amazing how often when an entrepreneur is interviewed that it comes out that they were a \\ndifficult employee and were fired from one or more jobs, or at least asked to leave. This comes back to not \\nsuffering fools gladly and always wanting to do things their way!\\n39 When I was a kid I had part-time jobs, or ran my own sideline business.  It’s in the blood, scratch \\nan entrepreneur and they’ll bleed lemonade. If you never had a lemonade stand, or knocked door-to-\\ndoor offering to wash windows, mow lawns or detail cars then you might be behind the eight-ball. Often \\nentrepreneurship is in the blood and surfaces early in life.\\n40 I don’t need a lot of fancy stuff in my life, I can live quite simply when I have to and not be \\ndepressed by it. When you are employed, someone magically puts money in your bank account every few \\nweeks and you know what to expect in terms of income, month to month, year to year. Not so when you \\nstart your own business. There will ups and down and often you may have little cash coming in. In the early \\nyears at least, you may have to manage on very little income - the question is can you lead the simple life?\\n41 I have a little money put by so that I can support myself for a year or so, if I need to.  Starting a \\nbusiness in any circumstance is difficult, even if you have adequate capital to put into it. But, if you are \\nliving hand-to-mouth before you start your business, then you are heading for difficult times. Ensuring you \\nhave some back up cash (or a second income-earner in the family) to allow you to survive while earning \\nlittle to nothing for a year or so is probably the most important thing you can do to protect yourself.\\nAs mentioned earlier, none of this is particularly scientific, but it has been gleaned from decades \\nof experience in working with start-up companies (over 2,500 of them) and from interviews with \\nhundreds of successful entrepreneurs.\\nTake from it as much, or as little, as you feel will help you make the right decision for you in terms \\nof entering the world of small business.\\nI wish you well in your great entrepreneurial adventure.\\nMike WicksPrince Albert & District Community Futures is a full service business \\ncentre providing small business loans from $5,000 up to $150,000 to help \\nindividuals start up a business or expand an existing business.
